stack_greedy: Paul's histology stack to MRI registration implementation
Usage:
  stack_greedy voliter [cmd_options] <project_dir>
Command Options:
  -na <iter>             : Total number of affine iterations [5]
  -nd <iter>             : Total numer of deformable iterations [5]
  -w <weight>            : Relative weight of the slice-to-volume metric
                           vs. the slice-to-neighbors metric [4.0]
  -wf <weight>           : Relative weight of the slice-to-volume metric
                           for slides marked as 'followers' in the manifest. 
                           Default: equal to -w
  -wdp                   : Use z-distance proportional weighting for neighbor
                           slices (default: neighbor slices have same weight)
  -R <first> <last>      : Only run a subset of iterations. Iterations
                           are counted starting with 1.
  -k <iter>              : Use the results of iteration 'iter' to initialize the
                           first registration. Use with -R to create a tree-like
                           structure of registrations.
  -i <name>              : Use an alternative image (registered via voladd) for
                           the registration.
  -M <manifest>          : Use an alternative set of slide images for this registration. The
                           manifest is in the form ID,FILENAME and must contain images that
                           match the input slides, although they are allowed to have different
                           dimensions and voxel size.
Options Shared with Greedy (see Greedy docs for more info):
  -m metric              : Metric to use for slice matching
  -n NxNxN               : Number of iterations per level of multi-res
  -threads N             : Number of allowed concurrent threads
  -gm-trim <radius>      : Generate mask for gradient computation 
  -s <s1> <s2>           : Warp smoothing parameters
  -e <eps>               : Optimization step size
  -sv                    : Use Diffeomorphic Demons algorithm
